Got it — for a **fast-paced CTF like SekaiCTF**, the **category-based architecture** is definitely more efficient.

When you’re in the middle of the competition, the main goal is **reducing context-switching** — so instead of remembering “oh, that web exploit script is in `/scripts/` and the XSS cheat sheet is in `/guides/`”, everything for Web is under `/web/`.

Here’s the **optimized category-first layout** with a rewritten, battle-ready README:

# 🏴 SekaiCTF 2025 — Category-Based Toolkit

A **single-stop repo** containing tools, guides, scripts, payloads, and writeup space for **SekaiCTF 2025**  
📅 **Aug 15–17, 2025 — Online, 48 Hours**

## 📂 Repository Structure (Category-First Layout)
This structure is designed for **zero-search time** — all resources for a challenge type live in the same folder.

## 📖 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/SekaiCTF-2025.git
   cd SekaiCTF-2025
   ```

2. **Go to your category** (e.g., `cd web/`) and use:

   * **`guides.md`** — quick payloads, bypasses, exploitation flow
   * **`scripts/`** — automation for recon or exploitation
   * **`tools/`** — ready-to-run binaries & utilities

3. **Document your work** in `notes.md` so teammates can continue if you switch challenges.

---

## 🚀 Event Workflow

1. **Pull latest changes** before starting work:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
2. **Check the scoreboard** → Pick a challenge in your strong category.
3. **Run recon scripts** from the category folder (or `/shared/recon/` for general use).
4. **Exploit** using tools/scripts already prepared.
5. **Record everything** in `notes.md` or create a subfolder in `/writeups/` for a detailed PoC.
6. **Push changes** to share with the team instantly:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update notes for Web challenge X"
   git push
   ```

**🎯 Goal:** Spend less time searching for tools, more time solving challenges.
*"Fast hands, faster brain."*

This **category-first model** means during the CTF you just ask: *“What category is this?”* and jump straight in.  
You don’t have to mentally map tools, scripts, and notes across different folders — everything lives together.  

If you want, I can also make you a **pre-filled skeleton** with empty `guides.md`, `notes.md`, and a couple of placeholder scripts in each folder so the repo is ready to go on day one. That way you can just `git clone` and start.
```
